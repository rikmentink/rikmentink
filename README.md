Software engineering student with hands-on experience building and maintaining production software.

I work mainly with Python and JavaScript on full-stack applications, including ERP-related systems, e-commerce and internal tools. I care about clear architecture, readable code and software that works in practice.

Currently pursuing a BSc in Software Engineering and looking to further grow as a professional software engineer.
